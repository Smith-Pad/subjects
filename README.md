# subjects

## What is it?

> Subjects is a platform in Smith-Pad, allowing students with special needs
> to learn a subject using many forms of learning, such as tactile learning,
> visual learning, and auditory learning.




## How does it work?
> Using AI technologies, teachers and paraprofessionals will able to simply
> prompt AI to create a lesson plan.

> Then it will utilize the template lesson interfaces, and create the entire
> interactive lesson based on the input of the Lesson Title and the Description
> of the lesson.






## Activating Scripts

Activating Scripts are required to activate some of the features in Subjects such as:

- Dynamic Routes in the backend
        - `sh activate-routes.sh`
- Latest Assignments Cards on the frontend
        - `sh activate-latest-assignments-cards.sh`

> If these two scripts are not used first, full functionality will not work for Subjects.
