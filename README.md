# subjects

# Status: Maintainance Mode ⚠️
> Right now, Subjects is currently in maintainance mode
> with some upgrades and some updates to it

## What is it?

> Subjects is a platform in Smith-Pad, allowing students with special needs
> to learn a subject using many forms of learning, such as tactile learning,
> visual learning, and auditory learning.




## How does it work?
> Using AI technologies, teachers and paraprofessionals will able to simply
> prompt AI to create a lesson plan.

> Then it will utilize the template lesson interfaces, and create the entire
> interactive lesson based on the input of the Lesson Title and the Description
> of the lesson.


# How does it work?

In this section, we are going to be talking about how it works.





# How it works: Paras Adding Assignments to devices.

In this section, we are going to be talking about how paras are able 
to assign individuals assignments/tasks to devices.


With the power of AI, and ML, Paraprofessionals are able AI prompt a lesson plan
with menu functions: 

- Lesson Title of the Lesson
- Lesson Description of the Lesson
- Type of Lesson

All of these three functions will get AI to create a full fledged interactive lesson
plan and ship to individuals devices.


The types of lessons that `04-add-assignments.py` in the backend gives is
listed here. 


- Camera based Hand Gesture Lesson Story **[FBA [Functional Behaviour Assessment]]**
- Talking Gesture Lesson Story [GIAG **[Gamified Interactive Learning Activity]]**
- Simple Talking Response Learning [STRL **[Simple Talking Response Learning]]**
- Puppet Response Learning [PRL **[Puppet Response Learning]]**
- Character Response Learning [CRL **[Character Response Learning]]**

> Just to let you know, paras will have the GUI version (obviously duh...)
> once this feature is stabled enough.




## `routes.py`

routes.py is a file that is used for dynamic reasons: 

- generating new subject generations
- generating new subject generations in lessons


## Terminalogy Q&A
In this section, we are going to be talking about terminlogies with Q&A.

> Q: What is Simple Talking Response Learning? 


> A: It is called Simple Talking Response Learning. As known as (STRL), Smith-Pad's 
> STRL learning allows specific individuals that are able to talk to specific single
> words like YAY, or NAY, or Yes or No.
