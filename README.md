## What is it?

> Subjects is a platform in Smith-Pad, allowing students with special needs
> to learn a subject using many forms of learning, such as tactile learning,
> visual learning, and auditory learning.


> Using sound effects in subjects, allows individuals to experience sounds while
> interacting with Smith-Pad's Subjects feature. The sound effects features is 
> still work in progress, but soon the sound effects features will be available 
> soon.


## How does it work?
> Using AI technologies, teachers and paraprofessionals will able to simply
> prompt AI to create a lesson plan.

> Then it will utilize the template lesson interfaces, and create the entire
> interactive lesson based on the input of the Lesson Title and the Description
> of the lesson.






## Is it cross platform? Compatibility?

> In Subjects, we are planning to create native apps with native components
> that are designed for each native operating system. Rather than having
> a cross platform based on electron, we want to respect by creating apps
> based on each of the Operating System's native App UI style guidelines.
> But that feature will arrive in the near future....
