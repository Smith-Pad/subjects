-- Use Cases--
    - Using the Intel Real Sense, this allows the ability to use real time performance data
      and actions when it comes to student's performance. Here are the use cases for this. 
      For example, in the lessons, it will have a section, in some lessons, where it will 
      ask the student (user) how are you feeling? Using those cameras it can detect the face
      and see the student's feeling. For example, if the students feeling is bored, then the 
      use cases of it, can be like this. The lesson level goes down, for example the content
      of the lesson is varied based on the lesson level.
