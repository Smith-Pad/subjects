## Q: What is Two Words Only Communication Learning (TWOC)?

## A: 

Two Words Only Communication Learning (TWOC) is a method where an individual 
communicates using only the words "YES" or "NO". 



### Example in a lesson


"Complete this activity. Order the numbers from the least to greatest. Here are
the numbers". This is where the individual needs to have time to look at them.

Casually, in the lesson, the user will be casually asked if they are ready to 
continue to sort the numbers from the least to the greatest after 2 minutes.

If they are not ready, they have the option to say NO, and if they are ready,
then they have the option to say YES.
