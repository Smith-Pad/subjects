# Installing Mediapipe

## Introduction

In this section, we will discuss the installation of MediaPipe, specifically for Apple Silicon devices. 
Installing MediaPipe directly on Apple Silicon is challenging due to the presence of two Python versions,
which is the Homebrew version and the generic version.


## Tools to use preferably

If you are a beginner, please use VSCode to create the tools 



## Creating the .venv environment in VSCode (Recommended)

Make sure you select the .venv in order to make mediapipe work. 

If you are not using Apple Sllicon to develop and contribute, please skip this step
