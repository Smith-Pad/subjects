# Installing Mediapipe

## Introduction

In this section, we will discuss the installation of MediaPipe, specifically for Apple Silicon devices. Installing MediaPipe directly on Apple Silicon is challenging due to the presence of two Python versions: the Homebrew version and the generic version.


## Tools to use preferably

- VScode


## For Apple Sllicon Devs...

Make sure you select the .venv in order to make mediapipe work. You don't have to do this if you are not using an Apple Sllicon.
