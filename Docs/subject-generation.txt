subject-generation
------------------

In this documentation, we are going to be talking about the subject 
generation. Subject generation allows the abilty to dynamically create
subject lessons. Some of the use-cases is making use of AI/ML models 
to dynamically create the lessons or manually create the lessons in a
more dynamic way. 


For now, this uses the bash script to manually prompt the user. We know 
what you are thinking. This is kinda "old fashioned", but this is used 
to demostrate what is like to create subject generations.
