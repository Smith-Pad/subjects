UI
------------------

In this documentation, we are going to be talking about the UI development. 
UI is a folder inside the Subjects source code, that allows the ability to
maintain the UI elements for the Subjects Feature in Smith-Pad, in the 
main directory. 


Here are the list of files in the UI/ directory:
				  ---

- horizontal-scroll-slider-container.scss
- subjects-top-bar.scss
- vertical-scroll-slider-container.scss
- widget-boxes.scss



Here are the description for each of the files in the UI directory: 

1. The Horizontal Scroll Slider Container allows the ability to scroll horizontally
2. The Subjects Top Bar allows the ability to add content on top of the interface
3. The Vertical Scroll Slider Container allows the ability to scroll vertically.


4. The Widget Boxes allows the ability to have widget boxes for many use-cases, 
   which can also be used as a button on the widget boxes itself
