# How it works: Paras Adding Assignments to devices.

In this section, we are going to be talking about how paras are able 
to assign individuals assignments/tasks to devices.


With the power of AI, and ML, Paraprofessionals are able AI prompt a lesson plan
with menu functions: 

- Lesson Title of the Lesson
- Lesson Description of the Lesson
- Type of Lesson

All of these three functions will get AI to create a full fledged interactive lesson
plan and ship to individuals devices.


The types of lessons that `04-add-assignments.py` in the backend gives is
listed here. 


- Camera based Hand Gesture Lesson Story **[FBA [Functional Behaviour Assessment]]**
- Talking Gesture Lesson Story [GIAG **[Gamified Interactive Learning Activity]]**
- Simple Talking Response Learning [STRL **[Simple Talking Response Learning]]**
- Puppet Response Learning [PRL **[Puppet Response Learning]]**
- Character Response Learning [CRL **[Character Response Learning]]**
